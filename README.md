Airbnb EDA Project
# Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes Airbnb listing data to uncover insights about pricing, availability, neighborhood trends, and customer preferences. The goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to better understand the factors influencing Airbnb bookings and host activity.

The analysis is conducted in Python using Jupyter Notebook, with visualizations and statistical summaries to interpret the dataset effectively.
